                Adam has always possessed a curious and inquisitive mind and is constantly looking for new challenges
                to help push him further. He is an accomplished problem solver and possesses strong analytical skills,
                both of which were improved tenfold throughout his degree in mathematics. During his study of complex
                analysis, Adam learned to not only put his logical skillset to good use, but to also adapt to even the
                most abstract of ideas. On top of this, he is resilient and determined, always looking to not only do
                his best, but to improve on his best. Unwilling to give up on a challenge, Adam will always give 100%
                in order to achieve any tasks presented to him.
